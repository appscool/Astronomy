			<h1>What is Astronomy?</h1>

			<p><strong>Astronomy</strong> is the scientific study of all objects in space. The word comes to us from the ancient Greek term for "star law." Astrophysics, which is part of astronomy, goes a step further and applies the laws of physics to help us understand the origins of the universe and the objects in it. Both professional and amateur astronomers observe the universe and devise theories and applications to help understand the planets, stars, and galaxies.</p>

			<h1>Unsolved problems in astronomy</h1>
			<p>Although the scientific discipline of astronomy has made tremendous strides in understanding the nature of the Universe and its contents, there remain some important unanswered questions. Answers to these may require the construction of new ground- and space-based instruments, and possibly new developments in theoretical and experimental physics.

			<li>What is the origin of the stellar mass spectrum?</li>
			<li>That is, why do astronomers observe the same distribution of stellar masses—the initial mass function—apparently regardless of the initial conditions?</li>
			<li>A deeper understanding of the formation of stars and planets is needed.</li>
			<li>Is there other life in the Universe? Especially, is there other intelligent life? If so, what is the explanation for the Fermi paradox? The existence of life elsewhere has important scientific and philosophical implications.</li>

			<h1>History</h1>
			<p>Although the scientific discipline of astronomy has made tremendous strides in understanding the nature of the Universe and its contents, there remain some important unanswered questions. Answers to these may require the construction of new ground- and space-based instruments, and possibly new developments in theoretical and experimental physics.
			Early cultures identified celestial objects with gods and spirits. They related these objects (and their movements) to phenomena such as rain, drought, seasons, and tides. It is generally believed that the first astronomers were priests, and that they understood celestial objects and events to be manifestations of the divine, hence early astronomy's connection to what is now called astrology. A 32,500 year old carved ivory Mammoth tusk could contain the oldest known star chart (resembling the constellation Orion). It has also been suggested that drawing on the wall of the Lascaux caves in France dating from 33,000 to 10,000 years ago could be a graphical representation of the Pleiades, the Summer Triangle, and the Northern Crown. Ancient structures with possibly astronomical alignments (such as Stonehenge) probably fulfilled astronomical, religious, and social functions.
			Calendars of the world have often been set by observations of the Sun and Moon (marking the day, month and year), and were important to agricultural societies, in which the harvest depended on planting at the correct time of year, and for which the nearly full moon was the only lighting for night-time travel into city markets.

			The common modern calendar is based on the Roman calendar. Although originally a lunar calendar, it broke the traditional link of the month to the phases of the Moon and divided the year into twelve almost-equal months, that mostly alternated between thirty and thirty-one days. Julius Caesar instigated calendar reform in 46 BCE and introduced what is now called the Julian calendar, based upon the 365 1⁄4 day year length originally proposed by the 4th century BCE Greek astronomer Callippus. </p>

			<h1>Is there gravity in space?</h1>
			<p>There is gravity everywhere. It gives shape to the orbits of the planets, the solar system, and even galaxies. Gravity from the Sun reaches throughout the solar system and beyond, keeping the planets in their orbits. Gravity from Earth keeps the Moon and human-made satellites in orbit.
			It is true that gravity decreases with distance, so it is possible to be far away from a planet or star and feel less gravity. But that doesn't account for the weightless feeling that astronauts experience in space. The reason that astronauts feel weightless actually has to do with their position compared to their spaceship. We feel weight on Earth because gravity is pulling us down, while the floor or ground stop us from falling. We are pressed against it. Any ship in orbit around the Earth is falling slowly to Earth. Since the ship and the astronauts are falling at the same speed, the astronauts don't press against anything, so they feel weightless.
			<br><br>You can feel something very like what the astronauts feel for a moment in a fast-moving elevator going down or in a roller coaster, when you start going down a big hill. You are going down rapidly, but so is the roller coaster or the elevator so for a second you feel weightless.

			<h1>How do objects in space travel?</h1>
			<p>Objects in space follow the laws or rules of physics, just like objects on Earth do. Things in space have inertia. That is, they travel in a straight line unless there is a force that makes them stop or change. The movement of things in space is influenced by gravity. Gravity is an important force that can change the course of bodies in space or pull them off of one course, or even cause them to crash together.
			<br><br>
			While some objects in space travel in irregular paths, most (especially our near neighbors in space) tend to travel in orbits around the Sun or around planets. The orbits are usually close to circular, but are actually slightly flattened ellipses.

			<h1>Is there energy in space?</h1>
			<p>There is abundant energy in space. Even though most of deep space (the vast stretches of empty area between planets, stars and moons) is cold and dark, space is flooded constantly by electromagnetic energy. All stars in the universe produce energy and send it out into space. Planets, asteroids and moons reflect that energy back, glowing in the darkness. They can also release energy themselves in the form of heat from volcanoes or other processes. Virtually everything in space is in motion, so there is also kinetic or motion energy in space.

			</figure>			
			<h1>What is escape velocity?</h1>
			<p>Since escape velocity depends on the mass of the planet or moon that a spacecraft is blasting off of, a spacecraft leaving the moon's surface could go slower than one blasting off of the Earth, because the moon has less gravity than the Earth. On the other hand, the escape velocity for Jupiter would be many times that of Earth's because Jupiter is so huge and has so much gravity. 
			<br><br>
			One reason that manned missions to other planets are difficult to plan is that a ship would have to take enough fuel into space to blast off of the other planet when the astronauts wanted to go home. The weight of the fuel would make the spaceship so heavy it would be hard to blast it off of Earth!

			<h1>How do we know what's in space?</h1>
			<p>Many of the bodies in space give off electromagnetic radiation. Things in space which release or reflect light, like stars or planets, can be seen either with the naked eye or with telescopes. By looking at that light, scientists can either directly tell where objects in space are, or at least can make deductions about their locations. 
			<br><br>
			Other bodies in space are too far away to be seen or are behind something that stops light. We can still find these objects because they give off radio waves that can be detected with radiotelescopes such as those in the deep space network (DSN). Not only do stars, nebulae and other extra terrestrial objects release radio waves, we hope that there is life in the cosmos using radio waves as well. The SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) project is specifically designed to try to detect radio, television, or other electromagnetic communications by intelligent aliens.

			</figure>

			There are many other things in space that are not emitting electromagnetic waves. Scientists must use deductive logic to detect them. For example, astronomers now believe that they have detected planets around other stars.. Although we have never "seen" these planets, there are wobbles in the the movement of their stars that could have been made by the gravity of planets pulling on them.
			<br><br>
			Even though observations made by telescopes tell us a lot both directly and indirectly about the universe, there are questions that can only be answered by sending ships like Deep Space 1 into space and making direct up-close observations. Sometimes those ships make accidental discoveries. Solar wind was detected once we started putting ships in space and found a slight push on them made by charged particles.
			<br><br>
			Scientists are still discovering everything that is in space and still finding new ways of learning more about the cosmos. The list of ways we know about bodies in space will grow and grow over time.

			<h1>Does heat travel differently in space than on Earth? </h1>
			<p>Absolutely. On Earth, heat travels by conduction, convection and radiation. In space conduction and convection are almost entirely nonexistent.
			<br><br>
			Radiation is the primary way that heat travels in space. That means that heat is not spread out through the medium it travels through as on Earth. On Earth on a sunny day, the heat radiating from the Sun warms the molecules of the atmosphere, and they warm other molecules and they warm others in turn. That conduction is what keeps the Earth warm at night when we aren't receiving direct Sun rays. It also means that even when we are standing in shadow, the air around us has some warmth. On Earth, heat also travels in large density-driven convection loops that spread out the warmth. In space, heat can only exist where the heat waves are traveling. This is one reason why there is a huge temperature difference between Sun and shadow in space.
